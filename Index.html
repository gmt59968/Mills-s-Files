<body style="background-color: black"> <h1 style="text-align:center"> The 27 Club: Lost Artists to an Unknown Phenomena <img src=index.jpeg width="1000" alt="Members of the 27 Club"> </h1> <h2 style=text-align:center> Background on the Phenomena </h2> <ul> <li> Sex</li><li>Drugs</li> <li> Rock & Roll </li> </ul> <p style="text-align:center"> The 27 club is a group of very talented artists that have all died at the age of 27. The people in this group include: Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, and Amy Winehouse. Their deaths were all unexpected but a majority resulted from a substance abuse problem. While their lives may have been short, their legacies live on forever </p> <p style="text-align: center"> This random occurrence has been widely discussed and investigated. but there is no way to distinguish it between coincidence and an actual curse. So the answer to the question of that is up to your own perspective. </p><p style=text-align:center> While the main five that are associated with the club are all from random occurrences it is particularly strange that  Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison all died within the span of about a year, all at the same age. This occurence is what made people start to think about the 27 Club.
